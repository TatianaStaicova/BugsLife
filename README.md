BUG TRACKING SYSTEM

Description

Rock Soft, a software development company, relied on shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This bug tracking system is error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by developers to be dropped or ignored. So they need a very good Bug Tracking System which can maintain the bug history and stores all details from bug origin to bug resolution. 

Bug Tracking System maintains bug history and stores all the details from bug origin to bug resolution. Bug Tracking System tracks all the information related to bugs/issues. While reporting a bug the testing engineer has to mention area (project, release), severity, priority, date/time, description (should contain steps to reproduce). Administrator should be able to configure Project, Release, and Bug status. 

Project is generally associated with a manager. If the testing engineer has raised a bug selecting a project, an email should go out to the manager corresponding to that project and also the developers/engineers associated with the project and reporting to him.

Manager assigns the bug to one of his teammates say ABC (now mail should be triggered only to go to ABC) and current owner of the bug should show as ABC. Once the bug is resolved the status should be updated with proper comments. This system also provides the searching based on status, priority, and operating system. It is provided with a fully authenticated system with password encryption. And has the facility for storing attachments for a bug. 

Requirements 

An ideal bug tracking system would allow users to track defects using the following operations: 

Raise the defect 
Assign the defect 
Change status 
Write comments 
Search defects by defect ID
